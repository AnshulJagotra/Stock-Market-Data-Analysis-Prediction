## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project aims to demonstrate key concepts in stock market data analysis. It covers:  
- Downloading historical stock data.  
- Calculating popular technical indicators like Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Bollinger Bands.  
- Visualizing stock price trends and technical indicators.  
- Analyzing the correlation between different stock prices.  
- *(Optional)* Building a simple model for stock price prediction.

## 📊 Data Source  
The data for this project is obtained using the **yfinance** library, which downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.  

---

## 📈 Technical Indicators Used  
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 50-day and 200-day averages to identify longer-term trends.  
- **Daily Returns:** Percentage change in price from the previous day.  
- **Bollinger Bands:** Measures volatility and potential overbought/oversold conditions.  

---

## 📉 Analysis and Visualization  
The project includes visualizations such as:  
- Line plots of stock prices and moving averages.  
- Bollinger Bands showing price volatility.  
- Histograms of daily returns.  
- Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps across multiple stocks.  

---

## 🔮 Prediction (Optional)  
If implemented, a **Linear Regression model** is used to predict future closing prices based on selected technical indicators.  
- Trained on historical data.  
- Evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
